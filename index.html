                <p> I'm passionate about medtech and biotech, especially devices used by clinicians to gather relevant patient
                  data and improve care. I am curious to learn about how devices function seamlessly so I may build and improve
                  them. It's fascinating how we can record signals from the body via devices such as heart monitors, medical imaging equipment,
                  and blood pressure monitors. </p>
                <p> In my classes, I have learned about the hardware powering these devices and explored
                  programming techniques like digital signal processing and normalization.

                As part of my class, I worked on measuring EMG signals from the traps and delts. I used
                gel electrodes and gathered data while lifting different amounts of weight to varying heights.
                This was a fun process and actually gave me the idea for SleeveAI. I knew this data could be gathered from the
                skin, I understood how it could be meaningful, and I wondered why it wasn't being used to its full potential.

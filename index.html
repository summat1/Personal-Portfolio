              <p> My passion is for medical devices, especially those used by clinicians to gather relevant patient
                data to improve care. I am curious to learn about how devices function so I may build and improve
                them. It's
                fascinating how we can record signals from the body via devices such as pulse oximeters, EEG/EKG/EMG,
                and blood pressure monitors. </p>

                <p> I've learned about the mechanisms behind
                  translating these analog signals to readable data via signal filtering, amplifying, and conversion
                  to digital form. I'm comfortable working with the hardware to build these processing pipelines as
                  well as further data cleaning using methods
                  such as digital signal processing and normalization. I would love to apply my skills working with
                  physiological data with a team on medical device
                  development.

                  I've begun prototyping a medical device and competing in business plan competitions for funding. We've
                  recently acquired initial funding that we are using to develop our MVP. We're competing at the

                  the importance of developing meaningful database schema and formatting. I created a syntax guide for
                  the team to help
                  standardize the data and made significant progress towards moving into a LIMS system.

                <p>
                  As part of a term project, I worked with a group to develop a fluid handling system that can take in
                  two
                  input fluids from containers and create mixtures, typically for dilution. I learned how to use an
                  Arduino Uno and
                  write code in the IDE. We tested the device with bleach and water, and experimented with setting
                  different desired
                  concentrations. I learned about needs in research settings and potential ways to solve them.

                  As part of my class, I worked on measuring EMG signals from the traps and delts. I used
                  gel electrodes and gathered data while lifting different amounts of weight to varying heights. This
                  was a fun
                  process and actually gave me the idea for SleeveAI. I knew this data could be gathered from the skin,
                  I understood
                  how it could be meaningful, and I wondered why it wasn't being improved.

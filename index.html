                  We were awarded funding from the Medici Grant (1517 Fund) and business plan competitions at UW to pursue our idea. Through this process, I've learned a 
                  great deal about startups as well as how to pitch an idea and capture an audience.

                the data with the matching unique tissue block ID. I spent time writing my own methods to manipulate inputs
                into consistent format. I also performed manual data cleaning and standardizing, which really helped teach me
                the importance of developing meaningful database schema and formatting. I created a syntax guide
                for the team to help standardize the data and made significant progress towards moving into a LIMS system.
